********* Assignment 6 (Event driven (customers and tellers))**********
In this Assignment we have to keep check of each and every event that were happenign in the bank. All the events are in Linkedlist of 
eventQueue and all the customers are in tellerQueue which is also implemented using Linkedlist.
For run the programm, you have to enter make commond in terminal. That would generate executable file having name "qSim".
for run the executable file with input of no of customers, no of tellers and others inputs, as that is in exe folder so we have to go there and
put the commond in terminal:
The qSim file is moved to the file exe.
All .o file are moved to the file obj.

./qSim #noofcustomers #nooftellers #simulationtime #avgservicetime

I have teken total 10 cases to analysis the relation between no of customers and no of teller assuming single line events.
Whatever the input is given through terminal, i am using that teller no to generate other 9 data.
I am increasing the teller no by one nine times and noting down the avg time spend by customers in all those cases in the file data.txt .
After that using that data.txt file i am drawing GNU plot.
All the graph and data.txt file are in exe folder.

As that is clear that as we increased the no of teller, the average time spend by customers would come less and less.
